Chroniquery is a python library that interacts with the chronicle-recorder
query mechanism.  It adds some abstraction.  Hooray.
This is a work in progress!

the bzr repository for chroniquery is here:
http://www.visophyte.org/rev_control/bzr/chroniquery/

chronicle-recorder lives here:
http://code.google.com/p/chronicle-recorder/

but this python library depends on changes I have made.  Option A is to get
them from my (st)git repository:
http://www.visophyte.org/rev_control/git/chronicle-recorder.git/
Note that the applied patches are on the acs-base branch.  If you can figure
out how to get at the underlying stgit patch definitions, they should be there
too.  Otherwise, you can get at the manually exported patches from:
http://www.visophyte.org/rev_control/patches/chronicle-recorder/
They should apply cleanly against rev13/15 of the chronicle recorder trunk.

To see something sorta working, you could do the following AFTER modifying
scripts/chronicle to have the right path to chronicle:
  cd examples; gcc loopy.c -g -o loopy; ../scripts/chronicle ./loopy
  cd python; python chronisole.py ../examples/loopy
